## Projects

### Exploratory Data Analysis of Car

**Objective: -**  Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and EDA to analyze car features and their relationship to market prices. Leveraged the Kaggle “Car Features and MSRP” dataset to uncover key trends, including price dynamics across new and used vehicles in the U.S. from 1990 to 2017.
- **Tech Stack: -** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
This project deepened my expertise in working with complex datasets, performing descriptive statistics, and visualizing insights to support data-informed decision-making.

### [Exploring GCP Components for Data Ingestion & Analytics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I1qZivY2eeWfimANRpndZVb44Ti-bAqFSTgPSqB-YH4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Objective: -** Designed a scalable data pipeline for ingesting Yelp batch data from Google Cloud Storage to BigQuery, utilizing Airflow DAGs and Dataflow. The pipeline parses JSON files stored in GCS and loads them into BigQuery for analytical processing.
- **Tech Stack: -** GCP (BigQuery, GCS, Composer, Dataflow), Apache Beam, Python.
This project enhanced my skills in using GCP for data ingestion, managing data workflows, and ensuring seamless data transfer for downstream analytics.

### Library management system

**Objective: -** Developed a web-based Library Management System for managing resources and user interactions. Built a robust backend using PHP and SQL, supporting dynamic content, user authentication, and a relational database.
- **Tech Stack: -** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL.
This project showcased my full-stack skills, including database management and user-centric interface design.

### Exchequer

**Objective: -** Collaborated in an Agile team to implement and test key features in Java and C/C++.
- **Role: -** Handled Bugs, Implemented new MFA Functionality using Java, Conducted unit and integration testing for reliability, participated in code reviews, and used Git for version control.
This project refined my skills in multi-site team collaboration and maintaining code quality in complex systems.

## Publications
